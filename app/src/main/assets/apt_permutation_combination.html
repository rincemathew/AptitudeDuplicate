      Factorial Notation:

      Let n be a positive integer. Then, factorial n, denoted n! is defined as:

      n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 3.2.1.

      Examples:

      We define 0! = 1.

      4! = (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 24.

      5! = (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 120.

      Permutations:

      The different arrangements of a given number of things by taking some or all at a time, are called permutations.

      Examples:

      All permutations (or arrangements) made with the letters a, b, c by taking two at a time are (ab, ba, ac, ca, bc, cb).

      All permutations made with the letters a, b, c taking all at a time are:
      ( abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba)

      Combinations:

      Each of the different groups or selections which can be formed by taking some or all of a number of objects is called a combination.

      Examples:

      Suppose we want to select two out of three boys A, B, C. Then, possible selections are AB, BC and CA.

      Note: AB and BA represent the same selection.

      All the combinations formed by a, b, c taking ab, bc, ca.

      The only combination that can be formed of three letters a, b, c taken all at a time is abc.

      Various groups of 2 out of four persons A, B, C, D are:

      AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

      Note that ab ba are two different permutations but they represent the same combination.
