  <h3>Boat and Stream</h3>
  <p>
    Downstream/Upstream:

    In water, the direction along the stream is called downstream. And, the direction against the stream is called upstream.

    If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:

    Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.

    Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr.

    If the speed downstream is a km/hr and the speed upstream is b km/hr, then:

    Speed in still water =	1/2	(a + b) km/hr.
    2
    Rate of stream =	1/2	(a - b) km/hr.

      <font color = "#009900">Answer:</font>Let the speed of motorboat in still water be x km/h. Then,
      Downstream speed = (x + 3) km/h.
      Upstream speed = (x – 3) km/h.
      Then, (x + 3) × 1 = (x – 3) × 3/2
      ⇒ 2x + 6 = 3x – 9
      ⇒ x = 15.
      So, the speed of motorboat in still water is 15 km/h.
