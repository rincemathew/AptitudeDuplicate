      <b>deduction</b>
      The phenomenon of deriving a conclusion from a single proposition or a set of given propositions, is known as logical deduction. The given propositions are also referred to as the premises.

      Two Inferential Processes of Deduction :

      I. Immediate Deductive Inference :

      Here, conclusion is deduced from one of the given propositions, by any of the three ways -conversion, obversion and contraposition.

      Mediate Deductive Inference (SYLLOGISM): First introduced by Aristotle, a Syllogism is a deductive argument in which conclusion has to be drawn from two propositions referred to as the premises.
