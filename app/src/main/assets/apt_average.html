If the ages of these two are excluded, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team. What is the average age of the team?<br>
                <font color = "#009900">Answer:</font>Let the average age of the whole team by x years.

          11x - (26 + 29) = 9(x -1)

          11x - 9x = 46

          2x = 46

          x = 23.

          So, average age of the team is 23 years.</b>
