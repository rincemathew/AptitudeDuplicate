      'BODMAS' Rule:

      This rule depicts the correct sequence in which the operations are to be executed, so as to find out the value of given expression.

      Here B - Bracket,
      O - of,
      D - Division,
      M - Multiplication,
      A - Addition and
      S - Subtraction

      Thus, in simplifying an expression, first of all the brackets must be removed, strictly in the order (), {} and ||.

      After removing the brackets, we must use the following operations strictly in the order:

      (i) of (ii) Division (iii) Multiplication (iv) Addition (v) Subtraction.

      Modulus of a Real Number:

      Modulus of a real number a is defined as

      |a| =		a, if a > 0,-a, if a < 0

      Thus, |5| = 5 and |-5| = -(-5) = 5.

      Virnaculum (or Bar):

      When an expression contains Virnaculum, before applying the 'BODMAS' rule, we simplify the expression under the Virnaculum.
