    <b>Question:</b>What is John’s present age, if after 10 years his age will be 5 times his age 5 years back.<br>
    <b>Answer:</b>Let John’s present age be x<br>
    John’s age before 5 years = (x - 5)<br>
    John’s age after 10 years = (x + 10)<br>
    We are given that, John’s age after 10 years (x + 10) is 5 times his age 5 years back (x – 5)<br>
    Therefore,<br>
    (x + 10) = 5 (x – 5)<br>
    Solving the equation, we get<br>
    x + 10 = 5x – 25<br>
    4x = 35<br>
    x = 8.75 years

    <b>Question:</b>One year ago, ratio of Harry and Peter age’s was 5 : 6 respectively. After 4 years, this ratio becomes 6 : 7. How old is Peter?<br></b>
    <b>Answer:</b>We are given that age ratio of Harry : Peter = 5 : 6<br>
        Harry’s age = 5x and Peter’s age = 6x<br>
        One year ago, their age was 5x and 6x. Hence at present, Harry’s age = 5x +1 and Peter’s age = 6x +1<br>
        After 4 years,<br>
        Harry’s age = (5x +1) + 4 = (5x + 5)<br>
        Peter’s age = (6x +1) + 4 = (6x + 5)<br>
        After 4 years, this ratio becomes 6 : 7. Therefore,<br>

        (Harry’s Age/6)	=	(Peter’s Age/7)<br>
        (5x + 5) / (6x + 5) = 6 / 7<br>
        7 (5x + 5) = 6 (6x + 5)<br>
        X = 5<br>
        Peter’s present age = (6x + 1) = (6 x 5 + 1) = 31 years<br>
        Harry’s present age = (5x + 1) = (5 x 5 + 1) = 26 years</b>

<p><b>Question:</b>Sharad is 60 years old and Santosh is 80 years old. How many years ago was the ratio of their ages 4 : 6?<br>
    <b>Answer:</b>Here, we have to calculate: How many years ago the ratio of their ages was 4 : 6<br>
    Let us assume x years ago<br>
    At present: Sharad is 60 years and Santosh is 80 years<br>
    x years ago: Sharad’s age = (60 – x) and Santosh’s age = (80 – x)<br>
    Ratio of their ages x years ago was 4 : 6<br>
    ((60 – x)/(80 – x)) 	= (4/6)<br>
    6(60 – x) = 4(80 – x)<br>
    360 – 6x = 320 – 4x<br>
    x = 20<br>
    Therefore, 20 years ago, the ratio of their ages was 4 : 6

<p><b>Question:</b>5 years ago, sister’s age was 5 times the age of her brother and the sum of present ages of sister and brother is 34 years. What will be the age of her brother after 6 years?<br>
    <b>Answer:</b>Let present age of brother be x and sister’s age be 34 – x.<br>
    Therefore,<br>
    (34 – x) – 5 = 5 (x – 5)<br>
    34 – x – 5 = 5x – 25<br>
    5x + x = 34 – 5 +25<br>
    6x = 54<br>
    x = 9<br>
    Future age (after 6 yrs) = (x + 6) = (9 + 6) = 15 years
