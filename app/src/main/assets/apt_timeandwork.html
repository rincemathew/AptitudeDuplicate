      Work from Days:

      If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work =	1/n	.

      Days from Work:

      If A's 1 day's work =	1/n	,	then A can finish the work in n days.

      Ratio:

      If A is thrice as good a workman as B, then:

      Ratio of work done by A and B = 3 : 1.

      Ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3.
