<h2>NUMBERS</h2>
<h3>Types of Numbers</h3>
<p>
    <b>Natural Numbers</b><br>
    The natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering (1,2,3,4,5,.......)<br><br>
    <b>Whole Numbers</b><br>
    Whole numbers are positive numbers, including zero, without any decimal or fractional parts.<br>
    Note:Every Natural number is a Whole number, '0' is the only Whole number which is not a Natural number.<br><br>
    <b>Integers</b><br>
    An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. <br>Example: -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3.<br><br>
    <b>Even Numbers</b><br>
    A number divisible by 2 is called an Even Numbers. <br>Example:2,4,6,8,etc<br><br>
    <b>Odd Numbers</b><br>
    A number divisible by 2 is called an Even Numbers. <br>Example:1,3,5,7,etc<br><br>
    <b>Prime Numbers</b><br>
    A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another number. Prime numbers upto 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.<br><br>
    <b>Composite Numbers</b><br>
    A composite number is a positive integer which is not prime. The first few composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, ...... <br>Note that the number 1 is a special case which is considered to be neither composite nor prime.<br><br>

<h3>Basic Formulae</h3>
<p><b>
    (a + b)<sup>2</sup> = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + 2ab)<br><br>
    (a - b)<sup>2</sup> = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab)<br><br>
    (a + b)<sup>2</sup> - (a - b)<sup>2</sup> = 4ab<br><br>
    (a + b)<sup>2</sup> + (a - b)<sup>2</sup> = 2(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)<br><br>
    (a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>) = (a + b)(a - b)<br><br>
    (a + b + c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2(ab + bc + ca)<br><br>
    (a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup>) = (a + b)(a<sup>2</sup> - ab + b<sup>2</sup>)<br><br>
    (a<sup>3</sup> - b<sup>3</sup>) = (a - b)(a<sup>2</sup> + ab + b<sup>2</sup>)<br><br>
    (a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + c<sup>3</sup> - 3abc) = (a + b + c)(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - ab - bc - ac)<br><br>
    When a + b + c = 0, then a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + c<sup>3</sup> = 3abc.<br><br>
    Dividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder<br><br></b>

<h3>Progression</h3>
<p>
    A succession of numbers formed and arranged in a definite order according to certain definite rule, is called a progression.

        <td><b><font color = "#009900">Question:</font>Product of two consecutive odd natural numbers is 13923. Find the smaller number.</b><br>
            <b><font color = "#009900">Answer:</font>Let the smaller odd number be (2n-1); the next conseecutive odd number will be (2n+1).<br>
                It is given that (2n-1)(2n+1) = 13923.<br>
                That is, 4n² - 1 = 13923<br>
                Hence, 4n² = 13924<br>
                or, 4n² = 13924<br>
                Thus, n² = 3481<br>
                n = 59.<br>
                Two consecutive odd numbers are, therefore (2n - 1) and (2n + 1) with n = 59.<br>
                The consecutive odd numbers with a product of 13923 are, therefore, 117 and 119.<br>
            The smaller number is 117.</b>
