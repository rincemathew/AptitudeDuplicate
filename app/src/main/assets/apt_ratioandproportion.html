<h2>RATIO AND PROPORTION</h2>
  <p>
      <b>Ratio:</b><br>

      The ratio of two quantities a and b in the same units, is the fraction a/b and we write it as a : b.<br>

      In the ratio a : b, we call a as the first term or antecedent and b, the second term or consequent.<br>

      Eg. The ratio 5 : 9 represents	5/9	with antecedent = 5, consequent = 9.<br>

      Rule: The multiplication or division of each term of a ratio by the same non-zero number does not affect the ratio.<br>

      Eg. 4 : 5 = 8 : 10 = 12 : 15. Also, 4 : 6 = 2 : 3.<br>

      <b>Proportion:</b><br>

      The equality of two ratios is called proportion.<br>

      If a : b = c : d, we write a : b :: c : d and we say that a, b, c, d are in proportion.<br>

      Here a and d are called extremes, while b and c are called mean terms.<br>

      Product of means = Product of extremes.<br>

      Thus, a : b :: c : d  (b x c) = (a x d).<br>
