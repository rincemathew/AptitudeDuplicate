        <b>Odd Numbers</b><br>
        A number divisible by 2 is called an Even Numbers. <br>Example:1,3,5,7,etc<br><br>
        <b>Prime Numbers</b><br>
        A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself. A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another number. Prime numbers upto 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.<br><br>
