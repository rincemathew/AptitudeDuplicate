      Simple Interest (S.I.):

      If the interest on a sum borrowed for certain period is reckoned uniformly, then it is called simple interest.

      Let Principal = P, Rate = R% per annum (p.a.) and Time = T years. Then

      (i). Simple Intereest =		(P x R x T)/100

      (ii). P =	(100 x S.I)/(R x T)		; R =(100 x S.I)/(P x T)		and T =(100 x S.I)/(P x R)		.
