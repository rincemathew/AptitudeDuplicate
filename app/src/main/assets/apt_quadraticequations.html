<h1>QUADRATIC EQUATIONS</h1>
  <p>
      In algebra, a quadratic equation is any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers, where a ≠ 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no term.<br>
      ax^2+bx+c=0<br>

      a, b, c	=	known numbers, where a ≠ 0<br>
      x	=	the unknown
