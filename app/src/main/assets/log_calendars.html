      Odd Days:

      We are supposed to find the day of the week on a given date.

      For this, we use the concept of 'odd days'.

      In a given period, the number of days more than the complete weeks are called odd days.

      Leap Year:

      (i). Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, if it is not a century.

      (ii). Every 4th century is a leap year and no other century is a leap year.

      Note: A leap year has 366 days.

      Examples:

      Each of the years 1948, 2004, 1676 etc. is a leap year.

      Each of the years 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 etc. is a leap year.

      None of the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 1800, 2100 is a leap year.

      Ordinary Year:

      The year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary years. An ordinary year has 365 days.

      Counting of Odd Days:

      1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day.)

      1 ordinary year has 1 odd day.

      1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days)

      1 leap year has 2 odd days.

      100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years

      = (76 x 1 + 24 x 2) odd days = 124 odd days.

      = (17 weeks + days)  5 odd days.

      Number of odd days in 100 years = 5.

      Number of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2)  3 odd days.

      Number of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3)  1 odd day.

      Number of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4 + 1)  0 odd day.

      Similarly, each one of 800 years, 1200 years, 1600 years, 2000 years etc. has 0 odd days.
