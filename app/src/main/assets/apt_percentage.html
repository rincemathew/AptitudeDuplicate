<h2>PERCENTAGE</h2>
  <p>
      By a certain percent, we mean that many hundredths.<br>
      Thus, x percent means x hundredths, written as x%.<br>
      To express x% as a fraction: We have, x% =	x/100.<br>
      Thus, 20% =	20/100	=	1/5.<br>
      To express	a/b	as a percent: We have,	a/b	=	(a/b x 100)	%.<br>
      Thus,	1/4	= (1/4x 100)%	= 25%
