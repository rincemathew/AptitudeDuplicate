      Inlet:

      A pipe connected with a tank or a cistern or a reservoir, that fills it, is known as an inlet.

      Outlet:

      A pipe connected with a tank or cistern or reservoir, emptying it, is known as an outlet.

      If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours, then:

      part filled in 1 hour =	1	.
      x
      If a pipe can empty a tank in y hours, then:

      part emptied in 1 hour =	1	.
      y
      If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours and another pipe can empty the full tank in y hours (where y > x), then on opening both the pipes, then

      the net part filled in 1 hour =		1/x	-	1/y		.
      x	y
      If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours and another pipe can empty the full tank in y hours (where x > y), then on opening both the pipes, then

      the net part emptied in 1 hour =		1/x	-	1/y
